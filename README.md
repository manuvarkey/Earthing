# Earthing

A python library for design of earthing networks in electrical substations. 



## Features

* Earth grid design as per IEEE 80/ ENA_ER_S34
* Numerical earth network calculations using using boundary descretisation method.
* Evaluation of earth resistance of various earth electrode geometries.
* 3D plotting of electrode geometry used for design.
* 3D plotting of current density distribution for the earth network.
* 2D/3D plotting of surface potential distribution.
* Ploting and evaluation of mesh and step potentials.
